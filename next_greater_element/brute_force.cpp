/*
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(nÂ²) because, for each element in the array (outer loop), we traverse the remaining elements (inner loop) to find the next greater element, leading to quadratic iterations in the worst case.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) as we use an additional vector to store the results, which requires linear space proportional to the size of the input array. This brute-force approach is straightforward and easy to implement but is inefficient for larger input sizes due to its nested loop structure.
