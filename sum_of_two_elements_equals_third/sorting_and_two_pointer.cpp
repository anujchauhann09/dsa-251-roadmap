/*
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the sorting and two-pointer approach is dominated by the initial sorting step, which takes (nlogn), where n is the size of the array. After sorting, the two-pointer traversal for each element runs in O(n). Since the two-pointer process is performed for each element in the array (in the worst case), the overall complexity of this approach becomes O(nlogn+n^2). However, the O(n^2) term dominates for large n, making the effective time complexity O(n^2).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) because no additional data structures are used apart from a constant number of variables for iteration and storing results. The sorting step modifies the input array in place, so no extra space is required for the sorting process. Hence, the space usage remains constant regardless of the input size.
