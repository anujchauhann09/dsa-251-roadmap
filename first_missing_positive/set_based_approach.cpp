/*
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) in the worst case. This results from inserting up to n elements into a set, where each insertion operation takes O(log n) due to the need to maintain the sorted order in the set. The final loop that checks for the missing integer iterates through the set, which is O(m), where m is the number of unique positive integers in the array, but m is bounded by n, so it does not increase the overall complexity beyond O(n log n).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) because, in the worst case, all elements in the input array are positive and unique, so they all get added to the set, requiring storage for up to n elements. Thus, the codeâ€™s time complexity is driven by the set insertion operations, while its space complexity depends on the storage of unique positive integers in the set.
